Then you have Detroit somehow being a dynasty in the mid 2000s? Lebron making a finals appearance  in 2007 with Zydrunas Ilgauskas as his second best running mate? This question has always perplexed me especially when you take a look at the west those teams were so densely packed Steve Nash's Suns, Kobe Shaq Lakers, Tim Duncan's Spurs, Carmelo AI Nuggets, Dirk Mavs.\n\nEdit: I haven't even mentioned from 98/99 to 2011/12 the East won 3 championships, 3 chips in 13 years.",

        "You pretty much answered your own question. The West was absolutely stacked. \n\nOn top of the teams you already mentioned you also had the TMac Yao Rockets, the Webber, Bibby, Peja Kings, Kevin Garnett on the TWolves. \n\nThe East had some great players and teams during that time, but the west had 3 consensus top 10 or 15 players of all time (Tim Duncan, Shaq, Kobe) while the East had none (until Shaq went to Miami but he was a shell of himself) until LeBron was drafted.",
        "Shaq, Duncan, Kobe, Garnett, Nowitzki - arguably the top 5 players in the 2000s were all on the West for most of their primes.",
        "Could write a long answer but quite simply terrible ownership throughout the East; there were a lot of genuinely clueless front offices back then. Your average team in the league is much smarter today than they were back then in a variety of ways from how teams see the game and how they prepare for it e.g. increased data use"
