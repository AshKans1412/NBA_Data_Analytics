    "Content": "Houston to me has been the most intriguing rebuilding team outside of my own team in OKC, both for the pierces they\u2019ve accumulated but also the sheer dysfunction of the internal structure and coaching. This offseason marks the second chapter of Houston\u2019s rebuild, seeking to implement a better system and fix their cultural issues with Ime Udoka now in town, but this rebuild still seems to hinge too much on Green\u2019s potential or lack thereof to reach superstardom. \n\nBefore anything else is said, I\u2019m not here to say the Rockets season is already lost or that Green will not take a third year leap. Yes, they did lose in ugly fashion to the Magic, but this was always going to be a squad that I think needs at least 20-30 games before we really see their true colors. I probably should\u2019ve made this post before the season started in all honesty, but better late than never.\n\nWith that being said, I do feel the roster construction and the long term future of the Rockets hinges greatly on Green\u2019s potential to ascend to superstardom, and this has likely been the case since he was selected number 2 in 2021, and even with the emergence of Sengun as the seemingly consensus best player in Houston it still seems as though the rebuild runs through Green. Houston spending their cap space on Dillon Brooks and Fred VanVleet signaled high confidence in the core the front office had drafted, or at least that was my interpretation. \n\nThis is all just a long setup to ask if Houston has a real path to contention if Green doesn\u2019t become a top 15-20 player in the league. Do they try and pivot to Sengun as the number one option if Jalen doesn\u2019t pan out, or will they eventually look to shake up the roster through trades if they don\u2019t feel confident in any guy being a number one option? Houston\u2019s core, while intriguing, has struck me as far more in jeopardy of being a failed rebuild as compared to the likes of Orlando and even Detroit who are on similar timelines.",

        "I think this is an important question to consider, and even though I got pooped on for saying the Rockets had a terrible offseason (draft aside!), I personally have a positive outlook on the answer.\n\nHouston has SO many talented youngsters that it's doing a disservice to the ones who haven't quite cracked big minutes. I might be in the minority, but I don't think that Jalen Green flatlining (not saying he will!) actually sinks the Rockets; they have other ways to emerge.\n\nCam Whitmore, Amen Thompson, Sengun, and maybe even Jabari (although I'm not as convinced) provide very, very high-ceiling players who can potentially become tentpole stars. Green's worst-case scenario is still a valuable NBA player. And we haven't even gotten to the talented but lower-ceiling guys like Tate and Eason who can contribute in a meaningful way.\n\nI don't think as much is riding on Green as most do. But I'm also a little lower on Green and higher on Thompson/Whitmore/Sengun than most, and I hate the fit of the veterans they added this offseason.\n\nTL;DR: I think they'll be fine, because I don't think Green is their only out."
